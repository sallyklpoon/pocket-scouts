# 🏝️ Pocket Scouts
Take your pocket scout with you to explore the world and meet other solo-travellers!

## ✨ Project Description
Pocket Scout is an application that will help users scout out other like-minded, solo travelers to spend time exploring cities and going on your next adventure. To embrace the ‘pocket’ in Pocket Scout, this application is designed as an Android mobile application for the mobility that travelers desire.

In addition to being fun, the product is also designed to increase safety awareness. Pocket Scout will incorporate security features to verify user’s identities. This way, users can reliably know who’s showing up to gatherings that are organized. After attending a hangout, a user can review the area where the event was hosted for security and safety, helping other fellow solo-travelers out during their trip to keep everyone safe.
