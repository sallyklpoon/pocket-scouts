# Mobile Dev Term Project
Take your pocket scout with you to explore the world and meet other solo-travellers! 🎒🤠✨🏝️

## Project Description
All the single travellers, put your hands up! Our generation enjoys travelling and are not afraid 
to do some solo-travelling. Pocket Scout is a travelling companion that will connect solo-travellers 
together across the globe.

Interested in meeting fellow solo-travellers for drinks or to go for a dive in the Mediterranean Sea? 
Host a gathering for other solo travellers to join in!
Looking for some company to do travel activities together? 
Look to join a gathering in the local area with ease.
And to make things even better, Pocket Scout will incorporate security features to verify everyone’s 
identities. This way, you can reliably know who’s showing up to your hangout. 
After attending a hangout, you can review the area for security and safety to help other fellow 
solo-travellers out during their trip to keep everyone safe.
Pocket Scout is an indispensable tool to every solo traveller looking to have 
fun and chill out in the sun~ 😎☀️
